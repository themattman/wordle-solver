# Wordle Solver

Weekend project to come up with automated strategies to solve Wordle.

High water mark of my solver:

Solves dictionary with `99.83%` success rate, `3.66696` average guesses in under 3 seconds.

## Overview

There is a `Checker` and `Solver`. These two entities comprise the Wordle game. The `Solver` is the "player" while the `Checker` is the "referee."

Each `Solver` can be mixed and matched with any `Selector`.

Currently the best combo is `TrieBasedWordleSolver` & `PositionalLetterWordleSelector`.

### Solvers

Role: Generate list of candidate words based on dictionary and results from prior guess.

- `WordleSolver`

  - Abstract Base Class. Interface for `Solver`s.

- `WordlistWordleSolver`

  - Abstract Base Class. Adds wordlist functionality.

- `PassthroughWordleSolver`

  - Intended for debugging `Selector`s. Does no processing of results.

- `TrieBaseWordleSolver`

  - Most powerful `Solver`. Uses a letter-based trie data structure to efficiently eliminate potential words based on results of prior guess.

### Selectors

Role: Choose which word in a given list of words should be selected for the current Wordle guess.

- `WordleSelector`

  - Abstract Base Class. Interface for `Selector`s.

- `RandomWordleSelector`

  - From an iterable list of candidate words, chooses candidate randomly.

- `EnhancedRandomWordleSelector`

  - Randomly choose candidate words that contain more than one vowel and do not contain double letters.

- `MostCommonLetterWordleSelector`

  - Abstract Base Class. Interface for `Selector`s that want to compute frequency scores over remaining candidate words.

- `NaiveMostCommonLetterWordleSelector`

  - Basic approach to computing score based on most common letters in all remaining words.

- `ImprovedMostCommonLetterWordleSelector`

  - Improved approach that doesn't score letters that show up multiple times (they're less common) AND letters that are already green (no effect, but it stands to reason).

- `PositionalLetterWordleSelector`

  - Computes which letter is most common in each position. Scores each candidate word based on this and selects best candidate.

- `FrequencyAndPositionalLetterWordleSelector`

  - Blend of overall scoring (frequency) and positional letter scoring

## Files

- `answers.txt`

  - Primitive 5-letter dictionary from the Internet

- `answers_extended.txt`

  - All allowed guesses, larger dictionary than `answers.txt`

- `guess_nums_6.csv`

  - Results from current algorithm, 6 guesses allowed (default)

- `guess_nums_7.csv`

  - Results from current algorithm, 7 guesses allowed

- `main.cpp`

  - `main()` lives here

- `wordle_checker.[h|cpp]`

  - Automated checking against an answer

- `wordle_checker_test.cpp`

  - Tests for the checker

- `wordle_helpers.h`

  - Static plumbing to make user interaction easier

- `wordle_rules.h`

  - Basic game constraints defined here

- `wordle_selectors.[h|cpp]`

  - Selection Algorithms to feed to `Solver`

- `wordle_solver.h`

  - Abstract Base class/interface for the `Solver`

- `wordle_trie.[h|cpp]`

  - Trie data structure used for Wordle

- `wordlist_wordle_solver.[h|cpp]`

  - More intelligent `Solver`s that use a dictionary

## ToDo

- [X] Better/Additional dictionary - i.e. include allowed guesses dict

- [ ] Select strategy from cmd line

- [X] Select mode from cmd line

- [X] Measure success rates of various algos against whole dictionary

- [ ] Define richer exceptions and catch them in main to help in debugging

- [X] Thread each parallel execution (Clang Mac doesn't support threading for loops :( )

- [ ] Break ties with more common letter in dictionary. TieBreaker class???? - mostly an unhit case

- [ ] Add aggressive `easy mode` `Solver` to knock out many letters with words not in remaining set. Likely to lead to 100% accuracy + lower average guesses.

- [X] Implement `hard mode` `Solver`

- [ ] Implement `hard mode` verifier

- [ ] Replace several size checks with NUM_LETTERS to consolidate understanding of what is tied to this global

- [ ] Raw pointers -> smart pointers

- [ ] Track lowest score of letter in word, sort on this somehow in getBestCandidate. Don't pick words with low lowest letter scores even if their score is the highest.

- [ ] How to optimize with easy (non-hard) mode guessing?

- [X] Wordle Cheat Mode, allow user to select a non-top choice and let algo run with that instead of the auto chosen word

- [ ] Make Selectors Composable (scoring, then selection should be done at another layer)

- [ ] Add wordle unicode decoder

- [X] Add arg parsing OR multiple binaries

- [ ] Check guess against guess dict

- [X] Support one output buffer per game, will help unlock multi-threaded game

|- FrequencyAndPositionalLetterWordleSelector* (owns behavior of selecting from a list of words)

```

### Buffer Dependencies:
WordleTrie::makeXXGuess()
main


The movement/ownership of WordleTrie within the TrieBasedWordleSolver is messing up Quordle. Need to think through it more now. unique_ptr to hold the Trie, deleting ctors to see if that breaks compilation (doesn't)

- [ ] processResult should return bool = true when complete to signal that the game was won, take this into account and mark each game as true and no longer consider their results
